Story:

It all began some time ago when one fine day in the
ladybug village the evil hoarde of beetlebugs
stormed the village and took prisoner 5 ladybugs
and for them they would leave the ladybugs alone.

The ladybugs summoned heros to rescue the
captured ladybugs and /many never returned.
You are one of those heros on a quest to rescue the
ladybugs and perhaps put an end to the invading
bettlebugs.

The queen of the ladybugs also promised to the hero
who could save the captured ladybugs the
hand in marraige to the most prettiest of all
princesses.


Controls:
Keyboard default (Arrows)
Joypad option


Move Ladybug through the maze-levels and eat all 
the food scattered about to complete each level.
There are gates which can be turned and used to block
the enemies from reaching you.


Letter that appear in each level will change colour.
Get the corresponding letters to its colour and receive
the reward.
i.e.
Red letters    E X T R A  - get extra Ladybug
Yellow letters B O N U S  - play a bonus level
Green letters  Z O N E    - select a new maze/zone to play in


There are also x2/x3/x5 mulitpliers which increase scoring.
They also change to specials:
Glasses - Invisibility for a time period
Potion  - Speed up for a time period.
The Special Power meter will show you how much time you have left.

IMPORTANT:
Adjusting the number of lives and difficulty level will alter how
much you score.
So making it easier to play will result in lower scoring for all
items.


Rescuing a captured ladybug can only be done when the enemies
all leave their lair, leaving the captured ladybug unattended.
Once the Ladybug is captuered, you must still finish the level and
continue to play that zone, until you spell [Z O N E].
In place of the captured ladybug, fruit bonuses will appear, gradually
earning higher bonuses.

Once the 5 ladybugs are rescued from each of the Zones, the game is
won.
It will reset with higher difficulty and continue until all lives are lost.
